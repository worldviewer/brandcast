# Directions

```
Attached is the ui/ux test I told you about. Don't feel like you have to finish everything, and you can interpret and build it however you would like. The random images folder are there for you to use as placeholders, it's not important that they match up with the menu items, so pick whatever images you want for each menu. Here are the instructions:

  1. Turn the flat jpg into html/css and js
  2. UI has a maximum pixel width of 1500px
  3. Center the UI horizontally on the screen
  4. Slider on the top right controls size of images.
  5. Interface on the left controls what images are displayed on screen.
  6. Menu indicator (small black vertical bar on the far left) slides up and down ui based on what menu is selected.
  7. UI is totally responsive. Images retain their ratio.

Feel free to write back and ask questions if the instructions aren't clear, or if you have questions about the product.
